I wanted to add a little more text to this assignment. In particular, my interests in the Earth Sciences stem from a desire to spur sustainable and green changes. When I was in college, I underwent the (common) existential crisis of understanding how climate change will change Earth's natural systems. While I had a previous understanding of climate change, it was solidified and built upon through taking various courses in college which pushed me towards the Environmental Studies. Participating in those courses were a watershed moment in my academic interests and motivator for future careers I want to pursue. In addition to this, I have a fervent love for the National Parks System and would love to work for them, the EPA, or USGS in the future. If I were offered an opportunity to work at Yellowstone, one of the Various Cascade Range volcano observatories, or perform a survey, I would take it in a heartbeat.
